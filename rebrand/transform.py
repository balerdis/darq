      been rewritten by :func:`substitute_body` before this check ever runs, so on the derivation
      path this half of the union can in practice never fire; it is kept anyway so an
      explicitly-renamed path (which skips derivation entirely) is still checked against it.
    - ``forbidden_fragments`` answers WHAT COUNTS AS a leak in the first place -- it can name a
      fragment with no corresponding rewrite rule at all (``"harness"`` is forbidden but nothing
      ever substitutes it), which is exactly the register the mirror needs to catch a fragment
      derivation alone would never have removed.

       of its source (``agents/king-pegasus.md`` -> ``agents/arquitecto-darq.md`` is the persona's
       new name, not a string swap of ``pegasus``).
    2. Otherwise, the path is run through the same substitution map (and the same protected-token

       merely carries the brand -- ``agents/pegasus-general.md`` -- is renamed for free, the moment
       the engine ships it, with no ``rebrand.json`` entry required.

       protected tokens first, so a legitimate wire identifier in a path is never mistaken for a
       leak): see :func:`_brand_fragments`, which is the UNION of ``rebrand.json``'s
