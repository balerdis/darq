"""No file in this fork may name the upstream engine's module, its source
path, or its agents by their upstream spelling.

This fork's package was renamed from `pegasus` to `darq`, so `pegasus.core`,
`pegasus.cli` and their siblings name modules that do not exist here. A
reference to one is a dead pointer: a reader following it finds nothing, and
so does anyone grepping for the module a docstring claims to explain. The
same fork also renamed its five generic agents, `pegasus-<role>` to
`darq-<role>`, plus one that follows no rule, `king-pegasus` to
`arquitecto-darq` -- a stray upstream agent name is the same dead pointer,
aimed at an agent this fork does not ship.

The rename itself was mechanical and complete. What keeps re-introducing
these is transport: a fix or a file authored upstream and brought over with
`git cherry-pick` carries upstream's own prose, and upstream correctly names
its own modules, its own source path, and its own agents. The cherry-pick
applies cleanly -- git tracks the directory rename -- and the stale spelling
rides in with it, unflagged, because the brand guardians in
`test_architecture.py` scan bundled adapter assets rather than engine source
prose, and, until this module grew agent-name coverage, nothing scanned
Markdown content at all. The first transport after the fork introduced
exactly one dotted-path leftover, in `cli.py`'s `_NUMERIC_VERSION` docstring.

This gate covers four forms of the same defect. `docs/transporte-desde-
pegasus.md` keeps the same table, kept in sync by hand:

1. A dotted module path -- `pegasus.core`, `pegasus.__main__`. Matched by
   `UPSTREAM_MODULE_PATH`, on the dot; see that pattern's own docstring below
   for why enumerating modules was tried first and abandoned.
2. The renamed source path split into separate string literals, the way a
   transport actually carries it one segment at a time --
   `Path(...) / "src" / "pegasus"`, `("src", "pegasus", ...)`,
   `os.path.join(..., "pegasus", ...)`, `.joinpath("pegasus")`, and the same
   shapes wrapped across several lines the way a formatter does it. Matched
   by `SPLIT_UPSTREAM_PATH_SEGMENT`.
3. That same path written as one string, including inside a regex, with or
   without the `src/` prefix -- `"src/pegasus/content/skills/"`,
   `r"src/pegasus/content"`, `"pegasus/content/skills/"`. Matched by
   `UPSTREAM_PATH_STRING`.
4. An upstream agent's own name -- `pegasus-orchestrator` and its three
   siblings, plus `king-pegasus` -- whether it appears in a file's own prose
   (`UPSTREAM_AGENT_NAME`) or as a file's own filename, with a body that
   never repeats it (`_agent_filename_offenders`, scoped to
   `src/darq/content/agents/`, the one place a bare filename carries the
   defect on its own).

An adversarial review of the first version of this gate found real gaps in
all four directions at once, folded in here rather than kept as a separate
history: `docs/` was not scanned at all, even though `docs/transporte-desde-
pegasus.md` itself proves a Markdown file can quote any of these four shapes
verbatim as a worked example (`_scanned_files` below now reads `.py` and
`.md` across `docs/` too, alongside `src/darq`, `tests` and `tools`); form 2
missed `os.path.join`/`.joinpath` calls and a segment split across lines by
a formatter; form 3 missed the same path spelled without its `src/` prefix;
and form 4 missed a bare filename. Each fix is explained where its pattern
or check is defined below, and each closed gap has a probe that failed
against the pre-fix pattern and passes against the current one.

Each pattern stays deliberately narrow to its own form, the same way
`UPSTREAM_MODULE_PATH` stays narrow to the dot: every wire identifier that
must keep saying `pegasus` forever -- the journal and report schemas, the
`pegasus_version`/`pegasus_installed` keys, the `PEGASUS_*` environment
variables, `.pegasus-` files, `pegasus-doctor`, `/pegasus/catalog-build`, and
the rest the runbook's table enumerates -- separates the word with an
underscore, a slash, or a hyphen in a shape none of the four patterns match,
so none of them needs an exemption for it. Prose that merely names the
upstream product does not match either; that remains a separate concern this
gate does not judge.

Two forms of split still escape, on purpose rather than by oversight, and
are measured in `test_a_nested_call_is_not_caught` and
`test_a_wholly_new_upstream_agent_role_is_not_caught`: a `"pegasus"`
argument buried behind a nested call inside `os.path.join(...)`/
`.joinpath(...)` (the non-greedy scan between the call's own parentheses
stops at the first `)`, which may belong to the nested call, not the outer
one), and an upstream agent role with no DARQ counterpart yet, which
derivation has nothing to read a role off of.

#: A dotted path into the upstream package: `pegasus.` followed by anything
#: that can start a Python identifier.
#:
#: This deliberately does not enumerate the modules. It did at first --
#: `(core|adapters|infra|ports|tui|cli|content)` -- and an adversarial review
#: found the hole immediately: the list left out `__main__`, a real module
#: upstream that upstream's own `test_version_guard.py` imports by name, so a
#: transported reference to it would have ridden in unflagged. An enumeration
#: of what exists is a list somebody has to remember to widen, and the whole
#: reason this gate exists is that nobody remembers.
#:
#: Matching on the dot is what keeps it safe. Every identifier that must keep
#: saying `pegasus` forever separates the word with an underscore, a slash or
#: a hyphen -- `pegasus_version`, `pegasus/cli-report/v1`,
#: `pegasus-harness/journal/v4`, `PEGASUS_SKILL_ROOTS`, `.pegasus-`,
#: `pegasus-doctor` -- and never with a dot followed by a letter, so none of
#: them can match here no matter how the engine grows.
#: Spellings where `pegasus.` IS followed by a letter and must survive anyway,
#: with the reason each one is here. Today there is one: `pegasus.md`, the
#: identity-blind default filename `Layout` carries for the Claude Code system
#: prompt -- a wire spelling this engine keeps deliberately, documented in
#: `adapters/claudecode/layout.py` and in `test_architecture.py`'s own
#: allowlist. It is a filename, not a module path, and the dot in front of a
#: file extension is indistinguishable from the dot in front of a package.
#:
#: Enumerating the exceptions is the opposite bet from enumerating the
#: modules, and it is the right one for a gate. A missing module fails OPEN --
#: the defect ships unseen, which is exactly how `__main__` slipped past the
#: first version of this pattern. A missing exception fails CLOSED -- a benign
#: spelling gets flagged, somebody reads it, and it lands here with its reason
#: written down. A guardian should be wrong in the direction that gets looked at.

#: Form 2: the renamed source path, split into separate string literals the
#: way a transport actually carries it -- one segment per literal, so no
#: single literal ever spells the whole dotted-or-slashed path the first
#: pattern above would catch.
#:
#: Four shapes, all anchored on a `"pegasus"` (or `'pegasus'`) literal whose
#: quoted content is the bare word and nothing else:
#:
#: - Path division: a quote-delimited `pegasus` immediately touching a `/`,
#:   either side (`Path(...) / "src" / "pegasus"` or `"pegasus" / "content"`).
#:   The anchor is the `/`, not the word `"src"` -- a caller may already hold
#:   the source root in a variable (`SRC_DIR / "pegasus"`), and this still has
#:   to catch it.
#: - A literal `"src"` segment immediately followed by a literal `"pegasus"`
#:   segment, comma-separated, the shape a tuple or list builds a path from
#:   (`("src", "pegasus", "content")`). Anchored on `"src"` here, unlike the
#:   division case, because without it this would also flag
#:   `("pegasus", "harness", "balerdis")` in `tests/brand_fragments.py` --
#:   a data list of brand words, not a path. `\s` between the two segments
#:   matches a newline as readily as a space, so a formatter wrapping the
#:   tuple one element per line does not defeat this -- and this pattern is
#:   applied to a file's whole text (`_scanned_files`/`_offenders` below),
#:   never split into lines first, precisely so a match spanning lines is
#:   still seen as one match instead of two half-lines that never meet.
#: - `.joinpath("pegasus")`: an upstream agent review found this escapes the
#:   two shapes above (no `/` touches the literal, no `"src"` precedes it).
#:   Bounded to the call's own parentheses with a non-greedy `[^)]*?` on each
#:   side, so `"pegasus"` is matched at any argument position --
#:   `ROOT.joinpath("pegasus")`, `ROOT.joinpath("a", "pegasus", "b")`.
#: - `os.path.join(..., "pegasus", ...)`: the same shape and the same
#:   bounding, for the one other path-building call this fork's style guide
#:   does not forbid.
#:
#: All four anchors are why a bare `"pegasus"` on its own -- `_package_files
#: ("pegasus")`, `asset = "pegasus"`, `sys.argv = ['pegasus']` -- never
#: matches: none of those touch a `/`, follow a literal `"src"`, or sit
#: inside a `joinpath`/`os.path.join` call, so this pattern leaves them alone
#: exactly as it should. Whether a bare, unanchored `"pegasus"` literal like
#: the `sys.argv` one is itself stale prose is a separate question this gate
#: does not answer, the same way it does not judge prose that merely names
#: the product.
#:
#: What still escapes: a `"pegasus"` argument behind a nested call inside
#: `join`/`joinpath` -- `os.path.join(str(ROOT), "pegasus")` -- because the
#: non-greedy `[^)]*?` stops at the first `)`, which belongs to the nested
#: `str(ROOT)` call, not to `join`'s own closing paren, so the alternative
#: never reaches `"pegasus"` before giving up. Measured, not assumed, in
#: `NoSplitUpstreamPathSegmentTest.test_a_nested_call_is_not_caught`. Closing
#: this would need real paren balancing, which a guard built on `re` does not
#: do; nothing in this fork's current style nests a call inside a path join,
#: so the gap is accepted rather than chased with a heavier tool.

#: Form 3: the same renamed source path, written as one string instead of
#: split across literals -- including inside a regex, where `r"src/pegasus/
#: content"` is exactly as dangerous as the plain string, and exactly as
#: unflagged by the first two patterns, since neither a dot nor a lone
#: `"pegasus"` literal appears in it.
#:
#: First anchored on the literal substring `src/pegasus`. But an upstream
#: agent review found a path spelled without that prefix --
#: `SKILLS_DIR = "pegasus/content/skills/"`, relative to an already-known
#: root -- escapes it entirely, so the pattern also matches `pegasus/`
#: immediately followed by one of this fork's own top-level source
#: directories, derived from the tree exactly the way agent roles are
#: derived below, never hand-typed: `pegasus/content`, `pegasus/core`,
#: `pegasus/adapters`, and so on, whatever `src/darq/` currently has. Real
#: package directories, not files, because a top-level *file* reference
#: (`pegasus/cli.py`, `pegasus/__main__`) is already the dotted form
#: `UPSTREAM_MODULE_PATH` catches, or would need a `.py` suffix this pattern
#: does not add on purpose -- adding it back would only re-derive a fact
#: `UPSTREAM_MODULE_PATH` already owns.
#:
#: Neither anchor matches `pegasus/` alone: `pegasus/capability-manifest/v1`,
#: `pegasus/model-assignment/v1`, `pegasus/artifact-catalog/v4`, `pegasus/
#: cli-report/v1` are live wire prefixes that must never be touched, and
#: `/pegasus/catalog-build` proves the slash can even come first -- none of
#: their second segments (`capability-manifest`, `model-assignment`,
#: `artifact-catalog`, `cli-report`, `catalog-build`) is a real directory
#: under `src/darq/`, and none of them is preceded by `src/`, so neither
#: branch of this pattern can ever reach them. The lookaround on each side of
#: the directory-name branch (`(?<![\w-])` / `(?![\w-])`) keeps a directory
#: name from matching as a mere prefix of a longer, unrelated segment the
#: same way `pegasus-doctor` must never trip on a bare `pegasus`.
